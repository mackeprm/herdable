# Herdable
I wanted to play around with ideas of having "herbivores" that travel around in groups,
search for food, remember food areas and so on.

Disclaimer: I have absolute no idea about game KI.

## Running
Import the build.gradle.kts into Intellij Idea and then run the main.kt
This works with Java 11, for some reason (I suspect processing) it does not
run with Java 14.
